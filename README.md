# Spring boot SSE(Server-Sent Event) DEMO

## Front end
- HTML5 + Javascript codes generated by GPT-4
- Connect to ``GET /events`` when page initialized
- Two buttons(1 and 2), clicked to emit json message to ``POST /events``, like ``{ "text": "sendButton1" }``
- Receive Event (json formated) from SSE connection, like ``{ "target": "sendButton1", "event": "clicked" }``
- Update the coutner of clicked times for current clicked button

## Backend, server side(powered by Spring boot)
- ``GET /events``, SSE endpoint
- ``POST /events``, for web client emit message to backend
